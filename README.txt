## ðŸ”¥ Introduction

My name is Rafael, Iâ€™m 30 years old, and I hold a degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), which I completed in 2022. Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve been working in front-end development, with a strong focus on React. Iâ€™m currently employed as a Software Developer at Softplan.

Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in the Web3 space. It started as a personal curiosity while following crypto-related content on YouTube, and gradually evolved into a professional pursuit. This led me to begin studying Solidity and exploring the smart contract ecosystem through hands-on learning.
